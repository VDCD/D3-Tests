# D3-Tests

##What is it?
Few tests I did with d3.js. Using .csv file to display points on page according to its data, I managed to play with them to try some D3 functionalities

##What can I do with it?
It's quite useless per say. It displays basic data display and some possible manipulations of this display. I think it's fun to try at least once though :)

##Where can I see these tests?
The 4 versions display points coming from mockup data in the set folder.
  
###Regroup all points on a line & move them all.

  Pleasant hover effect if you go from top to bottom by the way (if points are little, else just repress the button) :)
###Randomly change positions & size + different z-index gives depth impression.

###Puts them all on a single circle, and randomly change position on a regular time interval.

###Puts points on multiple circles and make them rotate in two different directions

##Can I use this code in my projects?
Sure, it's for everybody :)
