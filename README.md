# D3-Tests

##What is it?
Few tests I did with d3.js. Using .csv file to display points on page according to its data, I managed to play with them to try some D3 functionalities

##What can I do with it?
It's quite useless per say. It displays basic data display and some possible manipulations of this display. I think it's fun to try at least once though :)

##Can I use this code in my projects?
Sure, it's for everybody :)
